## Opening

I don’t claim to have read all the offerings in this popular subgenre, but I’ve read quite a few of them lately so I thought it might be fun to put together a list of my favorites. “Flintlock fantasy” is a nickname given to fantasy novels that meet some of these criteria:

- Gunpowder-based weaponry (early pistols and rifles)
- Technology at roughly the level of 19th century Europe/Americas
- Military strategy and tactics based on the above
- Magic (optional)
- Traditional fantasy storytelling elements (epic, heroic, or other)

## The point I’m making

More paragraphs here. If the image float is distracting, we’ll switch it to `float="none"` (or remove the float prop).

## A second section

More content.
